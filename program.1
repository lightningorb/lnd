## Subcommands

### `create`

Initialize a wallet when starting lnd for the first time.


	The create command is used to initialize an lnd wallet from scratch for
	the very first time. This is interactive command with one required
	argument (the password), and one optional argument (the mnemonic
	passphrase).

	The first argument (the password) is required and MUST be greater than
	8 characters. This will be used to encrypt the wallet within lnd. This
	MUST be remembered as it will be required to fully start up the daemon.

	The second argument is an optional 24-word mnemonic derived from BIP
	39. If provided, then the internal wallet will use the seed derived
	from this mnemonic to generate all keys.

	This command returns a 24-word seed in the scenario that NO mnemonic
	was provided by the user. This should be written down as it can be used
	to potentially recover all on-chain funds, and most off-chain funds as
	well.

	If the --stateless_init flag is set, no macaroon files are created by
	the daemon. Instead, the binary serialized admin macaroon is returned
	in the answer. This answer MUST be stored somewhere, otherwise all
	access to the RPC server will be lost and the wallet must be recreated
	to re-gain access.
	If the --save_to parameter is set, the macaroon is saved to this file,
	otherwise it is printed to standard out.

	Finally, it's also possible to use this command and a set of static
	channel backups to trigger a recover attempt for the provided Static
	Channel Backups. Only one of the three parameters will be accepted. See
	the restorechanbackup command for further details w.r.t the format
	accepted.
	

#### Flags

- `--single_backup`
- `--multi_backup`
- `--multi_file`
- `--stateless_init`
- `--save_to`


### `createwatchonly`

Initialize a watch-only wallet after starting lnd for the first time.


	The create command is used to initialize an lnd wallet from scratch for
	the very first time, in watch-only mode. Watch-only means, there will be
	no private keys in lnd's wallet. This is only useful in combination with
	a remote signer or when lnd should be used as an on-chain wallet with
	PSBT interaction only.

	This is an interactive command that takes a JSON file as its first and
	only argument. The JSON is in the same format as the output of the
	'lncli wallet accounts list' command. This makes it easy to initialize
	the remote signer with the seed, then export the extended public account
	keys (xpubs) to import the watch-only wallet.

	Example JSON (non-mandatory or ignored fields are omitted):
	{
	    "accounts": [
		{
		    "extended_public_key": "upub5Eep7....",
		    "derivation_path": "m/49'/0'/0'"
		},
		{
		    "extended_public_key": "vpub5ZU1PH...",
		    "derivation_path": "m/84'/0'/0'"
		},
		{
		    "extended_public_key": "tpubDDXFH...",
		    "derivation_path": "m/1017'/1'/0'"
		},
	        ...
		{
		    "extended_public_key": "tpubDDXFH...",
		    "derivation_path": "m/1017'/1'/9'"
		}
	   ]
	}

	There must be an account for each of the existing key families that lnd
	uses internally (currently 0-9, see keychain/derivation.go).

	Read the documentation under docs/remote-signing.md for more information
	on how to set up a remote signing node over RPC.
	

### `unlock`

Unlock an encrypted wallet at startup.


	The unlock command is used to decrypt lnd's wallet state in order to
	start up. This command MUST be run after booting up lnd before it's
	able to carry out its duties. An exception is if a user is running with
	--noseedbackup, then a default passphrase will be used.

	If the --stateless_init flag is set, no macaroon files are created by
	the daemon. This should be set for every unlock if the daemon was
	initially initialized stateless. Otherwise the daemon will create
	unencrypted macaroon files which could leak information to the system
	that the daemon runs on.
	

#### Flags

- `--recovery_window`
- `--stdin`
- `--stateless_init`


### `changepassword`

Change an encrypted wallet's password at startup.


	The changepassword command is used to Change lnd's encrypted wallet's
	password. It will automatically unlock the daemon if the password change
	is successful.

	If one did not specify a password for their wallet (running lnd with
	--noseedbackup), one must restart their daemon without
	--noseedbackup and use this command. The "current password" field
	should be left empty.

	If the daemon was originally initialized stateless, then the
	--stateless_init flag needs to be set for the change password request
	as well! Otherwise the daemon will generate unencrypted macaroon files
	in its file system again and possibly leak sensitive information.
	Changing the password will by default not change the macaroon root key
	(just re-encrypt the macaroon database with the new password). So all
	macaroons will still be valid.
	If one wants to make sure that all previously created macaroons are
	invalidated, a new macaroon root key can be generated by using the
	--new_mac_root_key flag.

	After a successful password change with the --stateless_init flag set,
	the current or new admin macaroon is returned binary serialized in the
	answer. This answer MUST then be stored somewhere, otherwise
	all access to the RPC server will be lost and the wallet must be re-
	created to re-gain access. If the --save_to parameter is set, the
	macaroon is saved to this file, otherwise it is printed to standard out.
	

#### Flags

- `--stateless_init`
- `--save_to`
- `--new_mac_root_key`


### `newaddress`

#### Flags

- `--conf_target`


### `sendmany`

Send bitcoin on-chain to multiple addresses.


	Create and broadcast a transaction paying the specified amount(s) to the passed address(es).

	The send-json-string' param decodes addresses and the amount to send
	respectively in the following format:

	    '{"ExampleAddr": NumCoinsInSatoshis, "SecondAddr": NumCoins}'
	

#### Flags

- `--conf_target`
- `--sat_per_byte`
- `--sat_per_vbyte`
- `--min_confs`
- `--label`


### `sendcoins`

Send bitcoin on-chain to an address.


	Send amt coins in satoshis to the base58 or bech32 encoded bitcoin address addr.

	Fees used when sending the transaction can be specified via the --conf_target, or
	--sat_per_vbyte optional flags.

	Positional arguments and flags can be used interchangeably but not at the same time!
	

#### Flags

- `--addr`
- `--sweepall`
- `--amt`
- `--conf_target`
- `--sat_per_byte`
- `--sat_per_vbyte`
- `--min_confs`
- `--label`


### `listunspent`

List utxos available for spending.


	For each spendable utxo currently in the wallet, with at least min_confs
	confirmations, and at most max_confs confirmations, lists the txid,
	index, amount, address, address type, scriptPubkey and number of
	confirmations.  Use --min_confs=0 to include unconfirmed coins. To list
	all coins with at least min_confs confirmations, omit the second
	argument or flag '--max_confs'. To list all confirmed and unconfirmed
	coins, no arguments are required. To see only unconfirmed coins, use
	'--unconfirmed_only' with '--min_confs' and '--max_confs' set to zero or
	not present.
	

#### Flags

- `--min_confs`
- `--max_confs`
- `--unconfirmed_only`


### `connect`

Connect to a remote lnd peer.


	Connect to a peer using its <pubkey> and host.

	A custom timeout on the connection is supported. For instance, to timeout
	the connection request in 30 seconds, use the following:

	lncli connect <pubkey>@host --timeout 30s
	

#### Flags

- `--perm`
- `--timeout`


### `disconnect`

Disconnect a remote lnd peer identified by public key.

#### Flags

- `--node_key`


### `openchannel`

Open a channel to a node or an existing peer.


	Attempt to open a new channel to an existing peer with the key node-key
	optionally blocking until the channel is 'open'.

	One can also connect to a node before opening a new channel to it by
	setting its host:port via the --connect argument. For this to work,
	the node_key must be provided, rather than the peer_id. This is optional.

	The channel will be initialized with local-amt satoshis local and push-amt
	satoshis for the remote node. Note that specifying push-amt means you give that
	amount to the remote node as part of the channel opening. Once the channel is open,
	a channelPoint (txid:vout) of the funding output is returned.

	If the remote peer supports the option upfront shutdown feature bit (query
	listpeers to see their supported feature bits), an address to enforce
	payout of funds on cooperative close can optionally be provided. Note that
	if you set this value, you will not be able to cooperatively close out to
	another address.

	One can manually set the fee to be used for the funding transaction via either
	the --conf_target or --sat_per_vbyte arguments. This is optional.

#### Flags

- `--node_key`
- `--connect`
- `--local_amt`
- `--base_fee_msat`
- `--fee_rate_ppm`
- `--push_amt`
- `--block`
- `--conf_target`

- `--remote_max_value_in_flight_msat`
- `--channel_type`
- `--zero_conf`
- `--scid_alias`
- `--remote_reserve_sats`


### `batchopenchannel`

Open multiple channels to existing peers in a single transaction.


	Attempt to open one or more new channels to an existing peer with the
	given node-keys.

	Example:
	lncli batchopenchannel --sat_per_vbyte=5 '[{
		"node_pubkey": "02abcdef...",
		"local_funding_amount": 500000,
		"private": true,
		"close_address": "bc1qxxx..."
	}, {
		"node_pubkey": "03fedcba...",
		"local_funding_amount": 200000,
		"remote_csv_delay": 288
	}]'

	All nodes listed must already be connected peers, otherwise funding will
	fail.

	The channel will be initialized with local_funding_amount satoshis 
	locally and push_sat satoshis for the remote node. Note that specifying 
	push_sat means you give that amount to the remote node as part of the 
	channel	opening. Once the channel is open, a channelPoint (txid:vout) of 
	the funding output is returned.

	If the remote peer supports the option upfront shutdown feature bit
	(query listpeers to see their supported feature bits), an address to
	enforce	payout of funds on cooperative close can optionally be provided.
	Note that if you set this value, you will not be able to cooperatively
	close out to another address.

	One can manually set the fee to be used for the funding transaction via
	either the --conf_target or --sat_per_vbyte arguments. This is optional.


#### Flags

- `--conf_target`
- `--sat_per_vbyte`
- `--min_confs`
- `--label`


### `closechannel`

Close an existing channel.


	Close an existing channel. The channel can be closed either cooperatively,
	or unilaterally (--force).

	A unilateral channel closure means that the latest commitment
	transaction will be broadcast to the network. As a result, any settled
	funds will be time locked for a few blocks before they can be spent.

	In the case of a cooperative closure, one can manually set the fee to
	be used for the closing transaction via either the --conf_target or
	--sat_per_vbyte arguments. This will be the starting value used during
	fee negotiation. This is optional.

	In the case of a cooperative closure, one can manually set the address
	to deliver funds to upon closure. This is optional, and may only be used
	if an upfront shutdown address has not already been set. If neither are
	set the funds will be delivered to a new wallet address.

	To view which funding_txids/output_indexes can be used for a channel close,
	see the channel_point values within the listchannels command output.
	The format for a channel_point is 'funding_txid:output_index'.

#### Flags

- `--funding_txid`
- `--output_index`
- `--chan_point`
- `--force`
- `--block`
- `--conf_target`
- `--sat_per_byte`
- `--sat_per_vbyte`
- `--delivery_addr`


### `closeallchannels`

Close all existing channels.


	Close all existing channels.

	Channels will be closed either cooperatively or unilaterally, depending
	on whether the channel is active or not. If the channel is inactive, any
	settled funds within it will be time locked for a few blocks before they
	can be spent.

	One can request to close inactive channels only by using the
	--inactive_only flag.

	By default, one is prompted for confirmation every time an inactive
	channel is requested to be closed. To avoid this, one can set the
	--force flag, which will only prompt for confirmation once for all
	inactive channels and proceed to close them.

	In the case of cooperative closures, one can manually set the fee to
	be used for the closing transactions via either the --conf_target or
	--sat_per_vbyte arguments. This will be the starting value used during
	fee negotiation. This is optional.

#### Flags

- `--inactive_only`
- `--force`
- `--conf_target`
- `--sat_per_byte`
- `--sat_per_vbyte`


### `abandonchannel`

Abandons an existing channel.


	Removes all channel state from the database except for a close
	summary. This method can be used to get rid of permanently unusable
	channels due to bugs fixed in newer versions of lnd.

	Only available when lnd is built in debug mode. The flag
	--i_know_what_i_am_doing can be set to override the debug/dev mode
	requirement.

	To view which funding_txids/output_indexes can be used for this command,
	see the channel_point values within the listchannels command output.
	The format for a channel_point is 'funding_txid:output_index'.

#### Flags

- `--funding_txid`
- `--output_index`
- `--chan_point`
- `--i_know_what_i_am_doing`


### `listpeers`

### `getinfo`

Returns basic information related to the active daemon.

### `getrecoveryinfo`

Display information about an ongoing recovery attempt.

### `pendingchannels`

Display information pertaining to pending channels.

### `sendpayment`

Send a payment over lightning.


	Send a payment over Lightning. One can either specify the full
	parameters of the payment, or just use a payment request which encodes
	all the payment details.

	If payment isn't manually specified, then only a payment request needs
	to be passed using the --pay_req argument.

	If the payment *is* manually specified, then the following arguments
	need to be specified in order to complete the payment:

	For invoice with keysend,
	    --dest=N --amt=A --final_cltv_delta=T --keysend
	For invoice without payment address:
	    --dest=N --amt=A --payment_hash=H --final_cltv_delta=T
	For invoice with payment address:
	    --dest=N --amt=A --payment_hash=H --final_cltv_delta=T --pay_addr=H

- `--max_shard_size_msat`
- `--amp`
- `--time_pref`
- `--amt`


### `sendtoroute`

Send a payment over a predefined route.


	Send a payment over Lightning using a specific route. One must specify
	the route to attempt and the payment hash. This command can even
	be chained with the response to queryroutes or buildroute. This command
	can be used to implement channel rebalancing by crafting a self-route,
	or even atomic swaps using a self-route that crosses multiple chains.

	There are three ways to specify a route:
	   * using the --routes parameter to manually specify a JSON encoded
	     route in the format of the return value of queryroutes or
	     buildroute:
	         (lncli sendtoroute --payment_hash=<pay_hash> --routes=<route>)

	   * passing the route as a positional argument:
	         (lncli sendtoroute --payment_hash=pay_hash <route>)

	   * or reading in the route from stdin, which can allow chaining the
	     response from queryroutes or buildroute, or even read in a file
	     with a pre-computed route:
	         (lncli queryroutes --args.. | lncli sendtoroute --payment_hash= -

	     notice the '-' at the end, which signals that lncli should read
	     the route in from stdin
	

#### Flags

- `--payment_hash, pay_hash`
- `--routes, r`
- `--skip_temp_err`


### `addinvoice`

Add a new invoice.


	Add a new invoice, expressing intent for a future payment.

	Invoices without an amount can be created by not supplying any
	parameters or providing an amount of 0. These invoices allow the payer
	to specify the amount of satoshis they wish to send.

#### Flags

- `--memo`
- `--preimage`
- `--amt`
- `--amt_msat`
- `--description_hash`
- `--fallback_addr`
- `--expiry`
- `--private`
- `--amp`


### `lookupinvoice`

Lookup an existing invoice by its payment hash.

#### Flags

- `--rhash`


### `listinvoices`

List all invoices currently stored within the database. Any active debug invoices are ignored.


	This command enables the retrieval of all invoices currently stored
	within the database. It has full support for paginationed responses,
	allowing users to query for specific invoices through their add_index.
	This can be done by using either the first_index_offset or
	last_index_offset fields included in the response as the index_offset of
	the next request. Backward pagination is enabled by default to receive
	current invoices first. If you wish to paginate forwards, set the 
	paginate-forwards flag.	If none of the parameters are specified, then 
	the last 100 invoices will be returned.

	For example: if you have 200 invoices, "lncli listinvoices" will return
	the last 100 created. If you wish to retrieve the previous 100, the
	first_offset_index of the response can be used as the index_offset of
	the next listinvoices request.

#### Flags

- `--pending_only`
- `--index_offset`
- `--max_invoices`
- `--paginate-forwards`
- `--creation_date_start`
- `--creation_date_end`


### `listchannels`

List all open channels.

#### Flags

- `--active_only`
- `--inactive_only`
- `--public_only`
- `--private_only`
- `--peer`


### `closedchannels`

List all closed channels.

#### Flags

- `--cooperative`
- `--local_force`
- `--remote_force`
- `--breach`
- `--funding_canceled`
- `--abandoned`


### `listpayments`

List all outgoing payments.


	This command enables the retrieval of payments stored
	in the database.

	Pagination is supported by the usage of index_offset in combination with
	the paginate_forwards flag.
	Reversed pagination is enabled by default to receive current payments
	first. Pagination can be resumed by using the returned last_index_offset
	(for forwards order), or first_index_offset (for reversed order) as the
	offset_index.

	Because counting all payments in the payment database can take a long
	time on systems with many payments, the count is not returned by
	default. That feature can be turned on with the --count_total_payments
	flag.
	

#### Flags

- `--include_incomplete`
- `--index_offset`
- `--max_payments`
- `--paginate_forwards`
- `--count_total_payments`

### `listchaintxns`

List transactions from the wallet.


	List all transactions an address of the wallet was involved in.

	This call will return a list of wallet related transactions that paid
	to an address our wallet controls, or spent utxos that we held. The
	start_height and end_height flags can be used to specify an inclusive
	block range over which to query for transactions. If the end_height is
	less than the start_height, transactions will be queried in reverse.
	To get all transactions until the chain tip, including unconfirmed
	transactions (identifiable with BlockHeight=0), set end_height to -1.
	By default, this call will get all transactions our wallet was involved
	in, including unconfirmed transactions.


#### Flags

- `--start_height`
- `--end_height`


### `stop`

Stop and shutdown the daemon.


	Gracefully stop all daemon subsystems before stopping the daemon itself.
	This is equivalent to stopping it using CTRL-C.

### `signmessage`

Sign a message with the node's private key.


	Sign msg with the resident node's private key.
	Returns the signature as a zbase32 string.

	Positional arguments and flags can be used interchangeably but not at the same time!

#### Flags

- `--msg`


### `verifymessage`

Verify a message signed with the signature.


	Verify that the message was signed with a properly-formed signature
	The signature must be zbase32 encoded and signed with the private key of
	an active node in the resident node's channel database.

	Positional arguments and flags can be used interchangeably but not at the same time!

#### Flags

- `--msg`
- `--sig`


### `feereport`

Display the current fee policies of all active channels.


	Returns the current fee policies of all active channels.
	Fee policies can be updated using the updatechanpolicy command.

### `updatechanpolicy`

Update the channel policy for all channels, or a single channel.


	Updates the channel policy for all channels, or just a particular channel
	identified by its channel point. The update will be committed, and
	broadcast to the rest of the network within the next batch.
	Channel points are encoded as: funding_txid:output_index

#### Flags

- `--fee_rate`
- `--fee_rate_ppm`
- `--time_lock_delta`
- `--min_htlc_msat`
- `--max_htlc_msat`
- `--chan_point`


### `fwdinghistory`

Query the history of all forwarded HTLCs.


	Query the HTLC switch's internal forwarding log for all completed
	payment circuits (HTLCs) over a particular time range (--start_time and
	--end_time). The start and end times are meant to be expressed in
	seconds since the Unix epoch.
	Alternatively negative time ranges can be used, e.g. "-3d". Supports
	s(seconds), m(minutes), h(ours), d(ays), w(eeks), M(onths), y(ears).
	Month equals 30.44 days, year equals 365.25 days.
	If --start_time isn't provided, then 24 hours ago is used. If
	--end_time isn't provided, then the current time is used.

	The max number of events returned is 50k. The default number is 100,
	callers can use the --max_events param to modify this value.

	Finally, callers can skip a series of events using the --index_offset
	parameter. Each response will contain the offset index of the last
	entry. Using this callers can manually paginate within a time slice.
	

#### Flags

- `--start_time`

### `exportchanbackup`

Obtain a static channel back up for a selected channels, or all known channels.


	This command allows a user to export a Static Channel Backup (SCB) for
	a selected channel. SCB's are encrypted backups of a channel's initial
	state that are encrypted with a key derived from the seed of a user. In
	the case of partial or complete data loss, the SCB will allow the user
	to reclaim settled funds in the channel at its final state. The
	exported channel backups can be restored at a later time using the
	restorechanbackup command.

	This command will return one of two types of channel backups depending
	on the set of passed arguments:

	   * If a target channel point is specified, then a single channel
	     backup containing only the information for that channel will be
	     returned.

	   * If the --all flag is passed, then a multi-channel backup will be
	     returned. A multi backup is a single encrypted blob (displayed in
	     hex encoding) that contains several channels in a single cipher
	     text.

	Both of the backup types can be restored using the restorechanbackup
	command.
	

#### Flags

- `--chan_point`
- `--all`
- `--output_file`


### `verifychanbackup`

Verify an existing channel backup.


    This command allows a user to verify an existing Single or Multi channel
    backup for integrity. This is useful when a user has a backup, but is
    unsure as to if it's valid or for the target node.

    The command will accept backups in one of three forms:

       * A single channel packed SCB, which can be obtained from
	 exportchanbackup. This should be passed in hex encoded format.

       * A packed multi-channel SCB, which couples several individual
	 static channel backups in single blob.

       * A file path which points to a packed multi-channel backup within a
	 file, using the same format that lnd does in its channel.backup
	 file.
    

#### Flags

- `--single_backup`
- `--multi_backup`
- `--multi_file`


### `restorechanbackup`

Restore an existing single or multi-channel static channel backup.


	Allows a user to restore a Static Channel Backup (SCB) that was
	obtained either via the exportchanbackup command, or from lnd's
	automatically managed channel.backup file. This command should be used
	if a user is attempting to restore a channel due to data loss on a
	running node restored with the same seed as the node that created the
	channel. If successful, this command will allows the user to recover
	the settled funds stored in the recovered channels.

	The command will accept backups in one of three forms:

	   * A single channel packed SCB, which can be obtained from
	     exportchanbackup. This should be passed in hex encoded format.

	   * A packed multi-channel SCB, which couples several individual
	     static channel backups in single blob.

	   * A file path which points to a packed multi-channel backup within a
	     file, using the same format that lnd does in its channel.backup
	     file.
	

#### Flags

- `--single_backup`
- `--multi_backup`
- `--multi_file`


### `bakemacaroon`

Bakes a new macaroon with the provided list of permissions and restrictions.


	Bake a new macaroon that grants the provided permissions and
	optionally adds restrictions (timeout, IP address) to it.

	The new macaroon can either be shown on command line in hex serialized
	format or it can be saved directly to a file using the --save_to
	argument.

	A permission is a tuple of an entity and an action, separated by a
	colon. Multiple operations can be added as arguments, for example:

	lncli bakemacaroon info:read invoices:write foo:bar

	For even more fine-grained permission control, it is also possible to
	specify single RPC method URIs that are allowed to be accessed by a
	macaroon. This can be achieved by specifying "uri:<methodURI>" pairs,
	for example:

	lncli bakemacaroon uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/GetInfo uri:/verrpc.Versioner/GetVersion

	The macaroon created by this command would only be allowed to use the
	"lncli getinfo" and "lncli version" commands.

	To get a list of all available URIs and permissions, use the
	"lncli listpermissions" command.
	

#### Flags

- `--save_to`
- `--timeout`
- `--ip_address`
- `--custom_caveat_name`
- `--custom_caveat_condition`
- `--root_key_id`
- `--allow_external_permissions`


### `listmacaroonids`

List all macaroons root key IDs in use.

### `deletemacaroonid`

Delete a specific macaroon ID.


	Remove a macaroon ID using the specified root key ID. For example:

	lncli deletemacaroonid 1

	WARNING
	When the ID is deleted, all macaroons created from that root key will
	be invalidated.

	Note that the default root key ID 0 cannot be deleted.
	

### `listpermissions`

Lists all RPC method URIs and the macaroon permissions they require to be invoked.

### `printmacaroon`

Print the content of a macaroon in a human readable format.


	Decode a macaroon and show its content in a more human readable format.
	The macaroon can either be passed as a hex encoded positional parameter
	or loaded from a file.
	

#### Flags

- `--macaroon_file`


### `constrainmacaroon`

Adds one or more restriction(s) to an existing macaroon


	Add one or more first-party caveat(s) (a.k.a. constraints/restrictions)
	to an existing macaroon.
	

#### Flags

- `--timeout`
- `--ip_address`
- `--custom_caveat_name`
- `--custom_caveat_condition`


### `trackpayment`

Track progress of an existing payment.


	Pick up monitoring the progression of a previously initiated payment
	specified by the hash argument.
	

#### Flags

- `--json`


### `version`

Display lncli and lnd version info.


	Returns version information about both lncli and lnd. If lncli is unable
	to connect to lnd, the command fails but still prints the lncli version.
	

### `profile`

Create and manage lncli profiles.


	Profiles for lncli are an easy and comfortable way to manage multiple
	nodes from the command line by storing node specific parameters like RPC
	host, network, TLS certificate path or macaroons in a named profile.

	To use a predefined profile, just use the '--profile=myprofile' (or
	short version '-p=myprofile') with any lncli command.

	A default profile can also be defined, lncli will then always use the
	connection/node parameters from that profile instead of the default
	values.

	WARNING: Setting a default profile changes the default behavior of
	lncli! To disable the use of the default profile for a single command,
	set '--profile= '.

	The profiles are stored in a file called profiles.json in the user's
	home directory, for example:
		~/.lncli/profiles.json on Linux
		~/Library/Application Support/Lncli/profiles.json on MacOS
	

### `state`

Get the current state of the wallet and RPC


	Get the current state of the wallet. The possible states are:
	 - WAITING_TO_START: node is waiting to become the leader in a cluster
	   and is not started yet.
	 - NON_EXISTING: wallet has not yet been initialized.
	 - LOCKED: wallet is locked.
	 - UNLOCKED: wallet was unlocked successfully, but RPC server isn't ready.
	 - RPC_ACTIVE: RPC server is active but not fully ready for calls.
	 - SERVER_ACTIVE: RPC server is available and ready to accept calls.
	

### `deletepayments`

Delete a single or multiple payments from the database.


	This command either deletes all failed payments or a single payment from
	the database to reclaim disk space.

	If the --all flag is used, then all failed payments are removed. If so
	desired, _ALL_ payments (even the successful ones) can be deleted
	by additionally specifying --include_non_failed.

	If a --payment_hash is specified, that single payment is deleted,
	independent of its state.

	If --failed_htlcs_only is specified then the payments themselves (or the
	single payment itself if used with --payment_hash) is not deleted, only
	the information about any failed HTLC attempts during the payment.

	NOTE: Removing payments from the database does free up disk space within
	the internal bbolt database. But that disk space is only reclaimed after
	compacting the database. Users might want to turn on auto compaction
	(db.bolt.auto-compact=true in the config file or --db.bolt.auto-compact
	as a command line flag) and restart lnd after deleting a large number of
	payments to see a reduction in the file size of the channel.db file.
	

#### Flags

- `--all`
- `--payment_hash`
- `--failed_htlcs_only`
- `--include_non_failed`

	Update the config values being used by mission control to calculate 
	the probability that payment routes will succeed.
	

#### Flags

- `--halflife`
- `--hopprob`
- `--weight`
- `--pmtnr`
- `--failrelax`


### `updatechanstatus`

Set the status of an existing channel on the network.


	Set the status of an existing channel on the network. The actions can
	be "enable", "disable", or "auto". If the action changes the status, a
	message will be broadcast over the network.

	Note that enabling / disabling a channel using this command ONLY affects
	what's advertised over the network. For example, disabling a channel
	using this command does not close it.

	If a channel is manually disabled, automatic / background requests to
	re-enable the channel will be ignored. However, if a channel is
	manually enabled, automatic / background requests to disable the
	channel will succeed (such requests are usually made on channel close
	or when the peer is down).

	The "auto" action restores automatic channel state management. Per
	the behavior described above, it's only needed to undo the effect of
	a prior "disable" action, and will be a no-op otherwise.

#### Flags

- `--funding_txid`
- `--output_index`
- `--chan_point`
- `--action`


### `wtclient`
